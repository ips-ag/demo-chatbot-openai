Way of working in IPS:
* IPS way of working relies on Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment.
* The main advantage of continuous integration is an overall improvement of software quality and development speed. Each time a newly developed feature is added to the main development branch in the version control system, the build process is started automatically. After successful build and deployment in a target environment, a set of automated tests is run. With this approach, most of the regression issues can be identified immediately after each feature is finalized.
* With continuous delivery, the source code and infrastructure are in “production-deployable” state at any time. By combining CI and Infrastructure as a Code (IaC), it is possible to achieve identical deployments across different environments and to deploy to a production environment at any time.
* With continuous deployment, it is possible to automate the entire process from code commit to production if all automated CI/CD tests are successful. Using CI/CD practices paired with monitoring tools, we can safely deliver features as soon as they're ready, while keeping the risk of introducing issues at a minimum.
